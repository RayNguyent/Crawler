# Crawler
Website URL: [nhadat24h](https://nhadat24h.net/nha-dat-ban)
## Introduction
Here is my crawler project developed using the `scrapy` library. Check the [Reference](#Reference) for the source I referred to. <br>
P/S: I only scraped some of the properties to make sure GitHub allows me to upload the data. Yet, my crawler is able to scrape all of the data from the website. I also use JSON instead of CSV to avoid font problems.
